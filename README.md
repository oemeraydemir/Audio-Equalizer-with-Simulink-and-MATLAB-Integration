# Audio-Equalizer-with-Simulink-and-MATLAB-Integration
This project aims to develop a versatile audio equalizer using Simulink for signal processing and MATLAB for advanced analysis, control, and user interface design. The equalizer will feature adjustable gain controls for low, high, and main frequency bands, along with a master volume control.
